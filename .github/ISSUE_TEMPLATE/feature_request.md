# ⚠⚠⚠ Please read this before asking for any instance or mechanic-related features ⚠⚠⚠

I do almost all content in this game without guides. You will probably see new raid bosses and mechanics before me, but **I don't want to know anything about any content I have not already cleared**.

You may discuss the following content:

- ✅ All content from Endwalker and earlier
- ✅ All ultimates (if I do these, I usually don't do them blind)
- ✅ Dawntrail extreme trials 1-4
- ✅ Arcadion: Light-heavyweight Division normal and savage
- ✅ Arcadion: Cruiserweight Division normal and savage
- ✅ Forked Tower

Please do not discuss the following content:

❌ All Dawntrail content that is not listed above

When discussing mechanics that are specific to some content, please indicate in the issue title which content it is so other people can avoid being spoiled as well.

**Describe the feature:**
What would you like to be added?

If you'd like a new object type, please consider:

1. Is this a commonly reused mechanic?
2. Is there no way to approximate it using the already supported objects?

If you answered "yes" to both questions, it sounds like something I should add. If not, you can still ask, but I may choose not to add it to keep XIVPlan simple.
